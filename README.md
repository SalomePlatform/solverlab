SOLVERLAB
======

SOLVERLAB is a geometrical and numerical C++/Python library designed for numerical analysts who work on the discretisation of partial differential equations on general shapes and meshes and would rather focus on high-level scripting. The goal is to provide simple MATLAB style functions for the generation and manipulation of meshes, fields and matrices. The library originates from [CDMATH](http://cdmath.jimdo.com), a collaborative workgroup with the same name. It is based on the [MEDcoupling](https://docs.salome-platform.org/latest/dev/MEDCoupling/tutorial/index.html) C++/python library of the [SALOME](http://www.salome-platform.org/) project for the handling of meshes and fields, and on the C++ library [PETSC](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) for the handling of matrices and linear solvers. 

SOLVERLAB includes PDE systems
arising from the modeling of nuclear reactor cores which involves fluid dynamics, heat and neutron diffusion as well as solid elasticity. It
is a simple environment meant at students and researchers for teachind and promote new numerical
methods on general geometries with unstructured meshes.  
The main research objectives of SOLVERLAB are the study of

- Numerical schemes for compressible flows at low Mach numbers on general meshes
- Well balanced schemes for stiff source terms (heat source, phase change, pressure losses)
- Numerical handling of flow inversion, phase disappearance and counter-currents in two phase flows
- Numerical handling of stiff porosity or cross section functions
- Schemes that preserve the phasic volume fraction α ∈ [0, 1]
- Convergence of finite volume methods
- New preconditioners for implicit methods for two phase flows
- The coupling of fluid models or multiphysics coupling (eg thermal hydraulics and neutronics or thermal hydraulics and solid thermics)

The library is currently developed for linux distributions and is maintained on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and 18.04 LTS, as well as on Fedora 24, 26, 28, 30 and 32.

Download SOLVERLAB sources to compile
----------------------------------

Create your source directory. For instance:
* `mkdir ~/workspace/SOLVERLAB`
* `cd ~/workspace/SOLVERLAB`

Download from salome-platform.org
* clone the git repository to a folder SOLVERLAB-master:  `git clone http://git.salome-platform.org/gitpub/modules/SolverLab.git SOLVERLAB-master`


Set the environment for the compilation of SOLVERLAB
---------------------------------------------
Dependencies. The following package list is sufficient on Ubuntu 14.04, Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04 :

 - `cmake3` (mandatory)
 - `g++` or another C++ compiler (mandatory)
 - `python-dev`, `python-numpy` and `swig3`for python scripts (mandatory)
 - `python-matplotlib` and `paraview` for postprocessing tools such as plotting curves (matplotlib) or generating 3D view images (paraview) (mandatory)
 - `doxygen`, `graphviz` and `mscgen`, if you want to generate a nice source code documentation in `~/workspace/SOLVERLAB/SOLVERLAB_install/share/doc/`. Use the compilation option `-DSOLVERLAB_WITH_DOCUMENTATION=ON` (optional).
 - `libcppunit-dev`, if you want to generate unit tests. Use the compilation option `-DSOLVERLAB_WITH_TESTS=ON` (optional).
 - `rpm`, if you want to generate RPM installation packages. Use the compilation option `-DSOLVERLAB_WITH_PACKAGE=ON` (optional).

Directories. Create the suggested build and installation folders:
* `cd ~/workspace/SOLVERLAB`
* `mkdir SOLVERLAB_build`
* `mkdir SOLVERLAB_install`
* `cd SOLVERLAB_build`


Compile and install SOLVERLAB
--------------------------
Simpler build for a minimum version:
* `cmake ../SOLVERLAB-master/ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../SOLVERLAB_install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release `  
> This will download and build the following dependencies
> - PETSc from http://ftp.mcs.anl.gov/pub/petsc/release-snapshots/petsc-3.14.0.tar.gz
> - SLEPc from https://slepc.upv.es/download/distrib/slepc-3.14.0.tar.gz
> - F2CBLASLAPACK from http://ftp.mcs.anl.gov/pub/petsc/externalpackages/f2cblaslapack-3.4.2.q4.tar.gz
> - HDF5 https://support.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/releases/hdf5-1.10/hdf5-1.10.3/src/hdf5-1.10.3.tar.gz
> - MEDFILE from http://files.salome-platform.org/Salome/other/med-4.1.0.tar.gz
> - MEDCOUPLING from http://files.salome-platform.org/Salome/other/medCoupling-9.4.0.tar.gz

If you already have an installation of PETSC, MED and MEDCoupling, you may save computational time and memory by using the advanced build version:
* `cmake ../SOLVERLAB-master -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../SOLVERLAB_install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" -D_ECLIPSE_VERSION=4.3 -DSOLVERLAB_WITH_DOCUMENTATION=ON -DPETSC_DIR=${PETSC_DIR} -DPETSC_ARCH=${PETSC_ARCH} -DMEDFILE_ROOT_DIR=${MEDFILE_ROOT_DIR} -DMEDCOUPLING_ROOT_DIR=${MEDCOUPLING_ROOT_DIR}`  
> This assumes that you have an existing 
> - install of PETSc (with submodules SLEPC and HDF5) at the location given by the environment variable PETSC_DIR and the architecture variable PETSC_ARCH  
> See the instructions given in [the official documentation](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/documentation/installation.html)
> - install of MED                                    at the location given by the environment variable MEDFILE_ROOT_DIR
> - install of MEDCOUPLING                            at the location given by the environment variable MEDCOUPLING_ROOT_DIR

The 3 dependencies PETSC, MED and MEDCOUPLING should have been compiled with the same version of HDF5  
Warning : the linux package libhdf5-dev is generally not compatible with the libraries MED and MEDCoupling
