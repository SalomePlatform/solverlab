    "# SolverLab documentation for Salome\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**SOLVERLAB** is divided into two Python packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `cdmath` gathers elementary tools to build and solve matrix systems\n",
    "- `CoreFlows` gathers tools for efficiently solving classical engineering problems\n",
    "\n",
    "**SOLVERLAB** brings together the `MEDCOUPLING` and `PETSc` libraries to create a powerful, practical and easy-to-use tool for solving partial differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is initially hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/ndjinga/SOLVERLAB) and a stable version is incorporated into **Salome**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "**SOLVERLAB** is installed with **Salome**. A set of resources is available in the installation: `path-to-salome/INSTALL/SOLVERLAB/share`, in particular the documentation for the `CoreFlows` module in pdf in `SOLVERLAB/share/doc` or in `doxygen` form gathering all the options available for each model can be found in `SOLVERLAB/share/doc/coreflows-dev-doc/html/index.html`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "Once **Salome** and **SOLVERLAB** have been installed, simply load the **SOLVERLAB** environment from the file present in the installation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source path-to-salome/INSTALL/SOLVERLAB/env_SOLVERLAB.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: 1D diffusion equation\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is taken from the heat equation example on [GitHub](https://github.com/ndjinga/SOLVERLAB/blob/master/CDMATH/tests/doc/1DHeatEquation/HeatEquation1D_RegularGrid.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Development in finite volumes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we consider the following diffusion equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = d \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "on the 1D domain, $\\Omega = [0,1]$ and where $d$ is the diffusion coefficient. Consider periodic boundary conditions on both sides and an initial condition of the form $u(x,t=0) = u_0(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation is to be solved numerically using the finite volume method. To do this  \n",
    "we start by decomposing the domain into N intervals $[x_i, x_{i+1}]_{i=1..N}$ of size $\\Delta x = 1 / N$.  \n",
    "Similarly, the time domain is discretized and the time interval is denoted $\\Delta t_n = t_{n+1} - t_n$.  \n",
    "So we're looking for mean values:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u_i^n = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x} \\int_{x_i}^{x_{i+1}} u(x,t_n) \\mathrm{d}x\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "on each space interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Development in finite volumes finally gives the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{u_i^{n+1} - u_i^n}{\\Delta t_n} = d \\frac{u_{i+1}^{n,n+1} - 2u_i^{n,n+1} + 2 u_{i-1}^{n,n+1}}{\\Delta x^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $u_i^{n,n+1} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} u_i(t) \\mathrm{d}t$. This quantity can be expressed simply using the rectangle formula  \n",
    "in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $u_i^{n,n+1} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t_n} \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} u_i(t) \\mathrm{d}t = u_i^n$ leading to an explicit solution with a stability criterion $\\Delta t_n \\lt \\Delta x^2 / 2d$.\n",
    "- $u_i^{n,n+1} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t_n} \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} u_i(t) \\mathrm{d}t = u_i^{n+1}$ leading to an implicit solution requiring the inversion of an (unconditionally stable) matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the explicit solution, we obtain :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u_i^{n+1} = u_i^{n} + \\frac{d \\Delta t_n}{\\Delta x^2} \\left( u_{i+1}^n - 2 u_{i}^n + u_{i-1}^n\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and for the implicit resolution, we obtain :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left(1 + 2 \\frac{d \\Delta t_n}{\\Delta x^2} \\right) u_i^{n+1} - \\frac{d \\Delta t_n}{\\Delta x^2} \\left[ u_{i+1}^{n+1} + u_{i-1}^{n+1}\\right] = u_i^n\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numerical solution\n",
