## Some bibliographical remarks about the two points finite volume scheme

- Order 1 convergence on orthogonal meshes : neighbouring cells  $C_i$ and $C_j$ must be separated by a face (or edge in 2D) $f_{ij}$ that is perpendicular to the straight line connecting the center of masses $x_i$ of $C_i$ and $x_j$ of $C_j$

- Order 1 convergence on not too deformed triangular meshes : the triangles edges must be in $O(h)$ and the triangle areas must be in $O(h^2)$ (angles must not shrink to $0{}^\circ$ nor $180{}^\circ$)

- Order 2 convergence on triangular meshes, provided 
    - the center of the circumscribed circle is used instead of the center of mass in each cell for the evaluation of the source term and analytical solution
    - the Delaunay conditions are satisfied (no neighboring cell is included in the circumscribed circle of an arbitrary cell)

- Order 1 if the mesh is conforming except on a line

- Order 2 on triangular meshes provided 1) Delaunay type conditions are satisfied and 2) $f\in H^1$ and meshes are generated from an initial mesh either by subdivisions,symmetry or translation

- It is possible to converge with order 1 on the gradient, but only order 1 on the function ie there is no equivalent of the Aubin-Nitsche lemma in the finite volume context
