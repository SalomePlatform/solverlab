# - Try to find CDMATH
# Once done this will define
#
#  CDMATH_FOUND        - system has CDMATH
#  CDMATH_INCLUDES     - the CDMATH include directories
#  CDMATH_LIBRARIES    - Link these to use CDMATH
#
#  Usage:
#  find_package(CDMATH)
#
# Setting these changes the behavior of the search:
#  CDMATH_DIR - directory in which CDMATH resides
