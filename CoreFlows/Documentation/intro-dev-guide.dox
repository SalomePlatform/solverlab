\section CFlows Presentation of SOLVERLAB

SOLVERLAB is a geometrical and numerical C++/Python library designed for numerical analysts who work on the discretisation of partial differential equations on general shapes and meshes and would rather focus on high-level scripting. The goal is to provide simple MATLAB style functions for the generation and manipulation of meshes, fields and matrices. The library is based on the [MEDcoupling](https://docs.salome-platform.org/latest/dev/MEDCoupling/tutorial/index.html) C++/python library of the [SALOME](http://www.salome-platform.org/) project for the handling of meshes and fields, and on the C++ library [PETSC](https://petsc.org/release/) for the handling of matrices and linear solvers. 

SOLVERLAB includes PDE systems
arising from the modeling of nuclear reactor cores which involves fluid dynamics, heat and neutron diffusion as well as solid elasticity. It
is a simple environment meant at students and researchers for teachind and promote new numerical

methods on general geometries with unstructured meshes.  
The main research objectives of SOLVERLAB are the study of

- Numerical schemes for compressible flows at low Mach numbers
- Well balanced schemes for stiff source terms (heat source, phase change, pressure losses)
- Flow inversion and counter-current two phase flows
- Schemes that preserve the phasic volume fraction α ∈ [0, 1]
- Convergence of finite volume methods
- New preconditioners for implicit methods for two phase flows
- The coupling of fluid models or multiphysics coupling (eg thermal hydraulics and neutronics or thermal hydraulics and solid thermics)

\section installation Standalone compilation from sources
However the SALOME binary file can be very large (up to 5GB). Compilation of SOLVERLAB from source files can provide a faster alternative using less disk and memory space.

In order to build SOLVERLAB on your system you will need
- the package [CMAKE](https://cmake.org/),
- a C++  compiler such as  [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/) 
- optionally [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run python language scripts 
- optionally [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/) for data visualisation.  

Detailed instructions for compilation and use of standalone SOLVERLAB can be found here \subpage install "Standalone compilation of SOLVERLAB from sources".


\section SolverlabInTerminal Use SOLVERLAB in a terminal

<b>Running Python scripts</b>

If you are not in a SALOME console you first need to load the SOLVERLAB environment in your terminal using the command
 - \verbatim source /path/to//SOLVERLAB_install/env_SOLVERLAB.sh\endverbatim
To run SOLVERLAB with your Python code `main.py `, simply type in your terminal or your SALOME console
 - \verbatim python3 main.py \endverbatim

<b>Launching SOLVERLAB graphic interface from a terminal</b>

If you are not in a SALOME console you first need to load the SOLVERLAB environment in your terminal using the command
 - \verbatim source /path/to//SOLVERLAB_install/env_SOLVERLAB.sh\endverbatim
Then to use the Graphical User Interface of SOLVERLAB, simply type in your terminal
 - \verbatim python3 $SOLVERLABGUI -g\endverbatim

<b>Running C++ scripts</b>

If performance or parallelism is an issue for your simulations, you can use SOLVERLAB librairies with your C++ code :
 - C++ libraries: \verbatim export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/SOLVERLAB_install/lib\endverbatim
 - To know how to include the right libraries for compilation, see the makefiles of the examples. They include the list 
  \verbatim -lmedC -lmedloader -lmedcoupling -lbase -lmesh -llinearsolver\endverbatim plus \em -lmpi if you are using a parallel version of SOLVERLAB.

<b>SOLVERLAB environment variables</b>

The SOLVERLAB environment variables consist in :
 - SOLVERLAB C++ library path: `/path/to/SOLVERLAB_install/lib`
 - SOLVERLAB Python library paths: `/path/to/SOLVERLAB_install/lib/SOLVERLAB:/path/to/SOLVERLAB_install/bin/SOLVERLAB`
 - PETSc, SLEPc and HDF5 library path: `${PETSC_DIR}/${PETSC_ARCH}/lib`
 - MED library path: `${MEDFILE_ROOT_DIR}/lib`
 - MEDCOUPLING library path: `${MEDCOUPLING_ROOT_DIR}/lib`

\section SolverlabGUI New SOLVERLAB GUI

A new GUI based on the library [PACKAGESPYGUI](https://github.com/ndjinga/PACKAGESPYGUI) is being developped for SOLVERLAB. In order to use the new GUI use the cmake option `-DSOLVERLAB_WITH_PACKAGESPY=ON` that will download the library [PACKAGESPYGUI](https://github.com/ndjinga/PACKAGESPYGUI) from github.
If you have a local copy of the library PACKAGESPY, give the to solverlab using the cmake option `-DPACKAGESPY_ROOT_DIR=${PACKAGESPY_ROOT_DIR}`.
