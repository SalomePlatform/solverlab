.. note:: All model are not implemented yet in the GUI.

You can now modify all the data on your model.
             
All model use *computation_parameters* and *numerical_parameters*.

*file_name* is the name of the result file solverlab at the end of the simulation. 

To launch the simulation you have to go in the *Analysis* section of the **TREE VIEW**.
Before launching the simulation check *Analysis* to select how you want to launch the simulation.

*name* under *Analysis/dataInformations* is the directory name where the result file will be stored. 

Choose to launch in foreground (this can stop the gui for a long time if the simulation is big) or background and launch another simulation.
